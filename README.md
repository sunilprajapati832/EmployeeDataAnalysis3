                              Corrected inconsistent data entries
                Data Exploration:
                              Statistical summary
                              Distribution of features
                              Correlation matrix
                Statistical Analysis:
                              Normal distribution checks
                              Confidence Intervals
                              Binomial and Poisson modeling
                Data Visualization:
                              Bar charts, line charts, histograms, Boxplots, scatter plots, heatmaps, Pie charts, treemaps
                Final Insights:
                              Gender diversity analysis
                              Salary growth patterns
                              Bonus effectiveness vs. performance
                              Departmental analysis for employee count and performance

🔧 Technologies Used
                Python 3
                Libraries:  pandas, numpy, scipy, matplotlib, seaborn, squarify
                PyCharm IDE
                Git for Version Control

📈 Key Insights
                Gender imbalance noted across several departments
                Salary does not linearly increase after a certain years of experience
                Bonus system optimization suggested
                Retention strategies needed for mid-experience employees
